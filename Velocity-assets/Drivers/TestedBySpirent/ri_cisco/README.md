# Cisco driver

This default Cisco driver works for Cisco Catalyst 3550. Its structure is very similar to MRV,
except for L2- and config-specific items. You can use this driver as a stub for implementing
other L2 drivers.

The driver implements the Configurable Layer 2 Switch interface and requires the
following resource properties:
* ipAddress (optional, but either ipAddress or Hostname must be specified)
* Hostname (optional, but either ipAddress or Hostname must be specified)
* username
* password

The Cisco driver has been tested for models 3750 and 2960.
