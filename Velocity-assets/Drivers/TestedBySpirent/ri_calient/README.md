# Calient driver

This is the default driver for Calient switches. The driver package contains the manifest file and
a single test case.

The driver implements the Layer 1 Switch interface and requires the following resource
properties:
* ipAddress (optional, but if omitted, Hostname must be specified)
* Hostname (optional, but if omitted, ipAddress must be specified)
* username - SSH username
* password - SSH password
* calientUsername - TL1 session username
* calientPassword – TL1 session password

Note: The Calient driver connects to the switch via an SSH connection using the “username”
and “password” credentials. Once the SSH connection is established, the TL1 agent> prompt
will appear, and the driver issues the ACT-USER TL1 command to activate the
“calientUsername” using its “CalientPassword” password string.

This driver requires the following to be configured on the Calient switch:
* An SSH user account on the Calient switch (the “username” property)

By default, an ssh user named “tl1user” exists on the Calient switch as a factory
default, and this ssh user can be used for the driver’s “username” property. This
account requires no password by default, so the “password” property can remain
blank.
* A TL1 user account with provisioning access (the “calientUsername” property)

In order to create and remove cross connects, a TL1 account with provisioning
access must have been provisioned on the Calient switch. By default, a TL1
user named “admin” exists on the Calient switch as a factory default and can be
used as the “calientUsername”. The default password for admin is “pxc***”, and
can be used as the “calientPassword” value.

## Readiness check
Below is a procedure to ensure that the Calient is ready to be managed by the Velocity driver.

SSH to the Calient using syntax like: ssh tl1user@10.140.64.30
* Where tl1user is the ssh username to be used as the “username” property
* Where the IP address is the Calient’s IP address or hostname
* If necessary, type a password for ssh access (the “password” property)
* If this step is successful, the agent> prompt should appear in the terminal
* Activate the user in TL1 with syntax like: act-user::admin:::pxc***
* Where admin is the TL1 username (the “calientUsername” property”)
* Where pxc*** is the TL1 password (the “calientPassword” value)

If this step is successful, the following response should appear in the terminal:

 TL1AGENT 16-12-03 13:45:16

M 0 COMPLD

 "admin:admin,2"

 /* NOTICE This is a private computer system. Unauthorized

access or use may lead to prosecution. */

;

If the SSH connection and activate user operations are successful, the Calient driver configured
with the appropriate credentials should now auto-discover the Calient ports and allow users to
create and delete cross-connects.
